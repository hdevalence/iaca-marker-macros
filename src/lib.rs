//! This crate has macros to generate markers for use by the Intel
//! Architecture Code Analyzer.  Note that it is UNOFFICIAL and not
//! affiliated with or endorsed by Intel IN ANY WAY.
//!
//! The `iaca_start_marker` macro marks the start of a block.  The
//! `iaca_end_marker` macro marks the end of a block.  After building
//! with `cargo build --release`, you can then point Intel's `iaca`
//! tool at the generated `.rlib` file.  See the [Intel
//! documentation](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer/)
//! for more details.
//!
//! These macros insert inline asm, so `#![feature(asm)]` is required.

/// Place this macro to mark the beginning of a code block.

        }
    };
